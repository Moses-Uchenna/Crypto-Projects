# WebAssembly - WASM

WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary-code format that defines a portable and efficient way to run code on the web. It is designed to enable high-performance applications on web pages, but it can also be employed in other environments as well. It defines a binary-code format and a corresponding text format for executable programs as well as software interfaces for facilitating interactions between such programs and their host environment. It is an open standard and aims to support any language on any operating system. It is named to evoke the concept of assembly language, a term which dates to the 1950s. The name suggests bringing assembly-like programming to the web, where it will be executed client-side — by the website-user’s computer via the user’s web browser. To accomplish this, WebAssembly must be much more hardware-independent than a true assembly language.
