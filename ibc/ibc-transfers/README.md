# IBC Transfers

## IBC Channels <a href="#ibc-channels" id="ibc-channels"></a>

Coreum IBC channels are the means of communication between different blockchains that use the Coreum IBC protocol. They allow the transfer of tokens, data, and smart contract calls across different chains, enabling interoperability and collaboration. Each Coreum IBC channel has a unique identifier, which specifies the source and destination of a transfer. Coreum IBC channels are secured by the consensus of the underlying chains, ensuring that the transfers are valid and consistent. Coreum IBC channels are a powerful feature of the Coreum network, which aims to create a decentralized platform for smart contract development and deployment.

The source of truth for active channels is the Cosmos Chain Registry: [https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/tree/master/\_IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/tree/master/\_IBC)
