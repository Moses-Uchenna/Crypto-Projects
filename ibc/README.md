# IBC

Coreum IBC is a protocol that enables interoperability between different blockchains that use the Cosmos-SDK framework. It allows for the transfer of arbitrary data and tokens across different chains, as well as the execution of smart contracts on any compatible chain. Coreum IBC is based on the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which is an open-source component of the Cosmos network.

Coreum IBC aims to provide a scalable, secure, and decentralized solution for cross-chain communication and collaboration. It leverages the advantages of the Cosmos-SDK, such as modularity, flexibility, and performance, to create a network of interconnected blockchains that can share resources and services. Coreum IBC also supports the development of custom smart contracts that can run on any chain that implements the protocol.

### Some of the benefits of Coreum IBC are:

* It enables cross-chain asset transfers, such as sending tokens or NFTs from one chain to another.
* It allows for cross-chain contract calls, such as invoking a function on a smart contract deployed on another chain.
* It supports cross-chain governance, such as voting on proposals or delegating stakes to validators on another chain.
* It facilitates cross-chain data exchange, such as querying information or verifying proofs from another chain.

Coreum IBC is one of the core features of the Coreum network, which aims to create a decentralized platform for smart contract development and deployment. By using Coreum IBC, developers can access a wide range of resources and services from different blockchains, and users can enjoy a seamless and secure cross-chain experience. Coreum IBC is a cutting-edge technology that brings innovation and interoperability to the blockchain space.
